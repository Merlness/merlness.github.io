## First Day

It seems like the conventional blog post for these sites is one of the technical matter. Since it is *Day 0* I will add a little flavor.

It was my first real day working on a mac. I've been using PC exclusively so this is quite a change. Two things I would say I prefer on the PC, the scrolling on the mouse (user preference), but especially the ability to drag my browser to the side and have it snap unto half of the screen and my code editor snapping on the other side.

Outside of this, the interface is pretty and most things seem intuitive. I am sure I will appreciate the lack of crashing in the near future.

As for the objectives of the day. Originally I created a very basic website, that did not allow for the creation of a blog like this. So I had to do it the right way and begin downloading the programs I needed to. Finding what programs I needed felt like a rookie cop trying to find clues in order to solve a mystery:

{% highlight c %}
I needed to use Jekyll to create the Github Pages blog
You need to edit the code in an editor like Atom
Atom best if connected to GitHub Desktop
Also need to install Git
Jekyll is not stand alone
Homebrew can download Jekyll
Cannot Download Homebrew
Need xcode-select to download Homebrew
Homebrew Downloaded!
Eureka! The end is in sight
Wait
...
rinse and repeat Eureka moments

until we are finally here.


xcode-select->Homebrew->Ruby(make sure the path is correct)->Chruby->Gem->Jekyll->Git->GitHub Desktop->Atom
(Fingers crossed I didn't miss anything)

{% endhighlight %}

I'm sure I will look at this moment and laugh at how easy *Day 0* is compared to many days in the future.

That's why I chose this picture of the cold, dark, and foggy Oregon Coast.
It maybe foggy, but there is beauty in the unknown.

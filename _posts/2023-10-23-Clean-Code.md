I have since been watching the Fundamentals of Clean Code. I Don't think I am allowed to mention too much about them but I will mention something that hit me, which is available on the youtube version which is free.


Since doing the Advent of Code challenges I have been focused mainly on one thing: completion. I have tried to make the variables nicely named and the code to be nicely spaced out and readable but not to a strong extent

I have been mildly cleaning my code and moving on to the next challenge.  

In the youtube video which is about the whole purpose of Clean Code, stories come up about programmers that are in a hurry to code and they leave their code a mess. Then their thoughts are "I'll clean the code later when I have time", but the time never comes and code is left messy and now the next person to look at such a thing will be left confused and it will take forever to make any necessary changes.

This is what I have been doing. Although my code has been relatively neat, my thought process has been the same. That is the major lesson for the day. Tomorrow I will focus on cleaning.

Till next time,

Merl

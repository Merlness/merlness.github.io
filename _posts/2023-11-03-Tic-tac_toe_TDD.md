I'll keep this short since It is the beginning. The current project is to do Tic Tac Toe with TDD.

This seems very helpful because the first time I did TTT it was messy. Don't get me wrong, I tried my best to make it and clean it up at that time. However, after even just a month of learning what I have written before I cringe at the thought of the previous TTT.

If you don't cringe you don't learn.  It is nice to have the opportunity to create a new TTT with this new knowledge.

My problems so far are: how to chunk it, writing tests that store the information that the source code will use,and how to write multiple files that call each other.

These are hills that will turn into stepping stones.

Until next time,

Merl

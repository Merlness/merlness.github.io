Let’s change it a little today focusing on focusing!

Sitting and working, not on my feet is a new experience for me. I have been teaching or TAing for the last 10 years so spending everyday sitting at a computer is new for me. Except in the summer when I would game non stop.

Needless to say it has been slightly challenging to stay completely on task.

Here are some tips I will follow to be even more productive.

# Put my phone away.

I know this is an obvious one, but I mean put it further away and on silent. Having it anywhere near is a recipe for distraction.

# Protecting my eyes.
I have noticed that my eyes have been a bit more tired. In fact, today in the mail, I just received my blue light glasses which help filter the blue light going towards my eyes. This will ease the strain on them and hopefully make my eyes less tired.

# After eyes, let’s go to ears.

If not in a quiet space, or there is lots of noise nearby, find some good headphones to drown out the noise, hopefully noise canceling headphones.


# A big one, focusing cycles.
Similar to circadian cycles which are a day long we have ultradian cycles which are 90 minutes long. According to Dr. Andrew Huberman, people focus best at 90 minute intervals. This means have a specific task or goal in mind to complete within 90 minutes. This will help chunk up what you need to as well as rest your mind in order to be in tip top shape for the rest of the day.

Not only this but do something else without focusing. Looking at your phone is a big no no. Maybe go on a short walk, do some dishes/laundry. Do something where your mind can wander for a bit then come back and focus again.

# Holistic Well-being.

Productivity isn't just about tasks; it's about overall health. Ensure you prioritize sleep,stay hydrated, nourish your body with wholesome food, and incorporate exercise into your routine. A healthy body is the foundation of a productive mind.

I know, I sound like my mother on that last one. And in fact, as simple as it is, I still need to hear this. I mentioned the walk earlier because it is a 2 birds with one stone situation. 

Clearing my workspace, donning the blue light glasses, letting the rhythm of the ultradian cycles guide me to prosperity is my goal. Oftentimes I have placed importance on being busy, but it’s about being purposefully productive.

Until Next time,
Merl

It is now my turn to join the greats in creating my own Bowling Game Kata video.

Originally, I was thinking of having a cool vibe and having an RnB track in the back playing while some lovely coding was happening.

Then I pondered on the wise words of old Bill Shakespeare "To thine own self be true"
To be fair when people think of me I am sure hip hop is a quality that comes up.  

I tried to create a hybrid version of what I had seen before, a mixture of explanation and vibes. A Vib-nation if you will.

All silliness aside, it is always a pleasure to be able to express yourself especially in forms you never would have thought you would have.

Without further adieu, here is the Kata.

I would say an underrated and not often discussed part of making videos is the music.

It is a garnish, but it can make or break your video. Like Maya Angelou said, “Music was my refuge.”

I have been looking at other people’s Kata’s and have seen what they have done. It seems like the standard is to just have music in the background. Very few have had verbal tutorials.

Maybe I’m thinking of this too much, but if I make it I want it to be good so I’ve been hyper fixated on the music.

Similar to Johnny Cash’s travels, I've been searching everywhere man to find the perfect song, also not to intrude on copyrights.


The tone, melody, and rhythm are important. Do you want it to be relaxed or up beat, how should someone feel when watching the video?

There are websites that have libraries of music to use. They aren’t always the best however. I have found that it might be possible to use sound cloud audio of popular songs that have been modified.


I will get back to you on these things soon. Happy hunting to me. Until next time.

Best,

Merl

It is a rewarding experience to create something and bring it out into the world. An additional thread to the world wide web.

In this project, I decided to revisit a previous idea, but with a twist. I wanted to infuse it with a bit of my own style, particularly in terms of sound. Growing up, hip hop was my sanctuary, my source of comfort. So, my goal was to incorporate some groovy, rhythmic beats that echo this personal connection.

As you watch this video, I hope it resonates with you in the same way it does with me. I hope it makes you feel the rhythm, the passion, and the joy that I felt while creating it.

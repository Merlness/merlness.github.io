One of my favorite learning opportunities has been making these videos. Adding my own flair, while solving a problem.

I am still trying to find a nice balance with how to do these videos. Is typing it enough? Should I do a voice over the whole time saying my thoughts aloud for others to hear. Should I do it half the time, or is the code good enough for others to learn from.

I remember I have watched some previous katas before and been slightly lost in what they were doing. I knew their end goal, however since I am new to these languages the syntax can be confusing, as well as the functionality.

As I am writing this I have come to this realization. I think for the next video I will voice over exactly what i am doing so if anyone is new like me wonâ€™t be confused when they see it.

Until then, I hope you like the song in this video.

I am incredibly happy because I have accomplished what I wanted to do for many weeks, that is save the game!

I can save the a game mid game, cancel, and resume normally by putting in the id or by the computer asking me. I can resume any previous game that is incomplete as well, Human vs human, human vs AI, AI vs AI it doesnâ€™t matter.

That is the wonderful thing. The interesting thing is I need to refactor how I save. It takes too much space and can be done better.

```clojure
[{:game-id 94,
:player-1? false,
:board ("X" 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27), 
:player-1 {:kind :human, :token "X"},
:player-2 {:kind :ai, :token "O", :difficulty :hard}}


{:game-id 94,
:player-1? true,
:board ("X" 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 "O" 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27),
:player-1 {:kind :human, :token "X"}, :player-2 {:kind :ai, :token "O", :difficulty :hard}}]
```

There are two things I need to fix.

First these maps are saved in a vector, and they both contain the game id. These should be saved into a map instead of a vector and their key should be their game-id.

Second, I need to save my board with less data, so I should specify what kind of board it is and contain a list of which moves we played in what other. I will provide an example to demonstrate.

```clojure
{94
{ :player-1? false
:player-1 {:kind :human, :token "X"},
:player-2 {:kind :ai, :token "O", :difficulty :hard}
:board :3x3x3
:moves [1 14] }
}
```

As you can see These are the same 2 moves but one is more succinct and takes up was less space!

I will look to implement this new change in the future.

Best,

Merl

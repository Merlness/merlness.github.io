I have been practicing my Game of Life Kata. In that process I have been given some incredible advice on how to proceed.

When I first wrote Game of Life, very recently, I began at the low level details and worked my way up. I know this is not the best course of action, but implementing such a thing is not easy. It is simple but not easy.

I began to redo my whole method of doing the Game of Life. I began at the end with `evolve`, and worked my way up to getting the neighbors and the state of the current cell.

This process helped limit a few of my previous functions and made my tests more robust. I now have fewer tests but they are more meaningful.

You can see my work in action, here:

I hope you enjoyed it, until next time.

I have been spoiled by Clojure and Python. The dynamically typed languages so far are my favorite. They help make life easier for me, which I am all about!

I do however have to learn for the rest of my life, so it would be wise to learn and get better at Java. 

I was trying to create a hash map in Java. But I have not been making the map as succinct as it should be.


```java
public void put(Key key, Value value) {
   int bucket = key.hashCode() % numberOfBuckets;
   Pair<Key, Value> pair = table[bucket];


   if (pair == null) {
       table[bucket] = new Pair<Key, Value>(key, value);
   } else {
       while (pair.next != null) {
           if (pair.isKey(key)) {
               pair.value = value;
               return;
           }
           pair = pair.next;
       }
       if (pair.getKey().equals(key)) {
           pair.setValue(value);
           return;
       }
       pair.next = new Pair<Key, Value>(key, value);
   }
}
```

This is what was written before. I should be able to use Linked lists and array lists to make life easier for myself.

Here I am recreating what a linked list already does. I need to implement what the list already does into this code. As well as just refactor in general.

Here is my current attempt so far.


```java
public void put(Key key, Value value) {
   int bucket = key.hashCode() % numberOfBuckets;
   LinkedList<Pair<Key, Value>> list = table.get(bucket);


   for (Pair<Key, Value> pair : list) {
       if (pair.getKey().equals(key)) {
           pair.setValue(value);
           return;
       }
   }
   list.add(new Pair<>(key, value));
}
```

Sometimes the simpler things take longer to `put` down.

Slowly but surely I will get better at Java.

Best,

Merl

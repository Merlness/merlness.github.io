Learning is definitely not linear, however it is important to learn in a particular way especially when there are deadlines in place.

I am trying to find a way to connect my Tic Tac Toe game to a GUI that can display the game while having the logic in the background.

I was so excited that I went into the display of my Os and my Xs. I went into great detail on how they should look like. I was able to make lines that could split the board into 3x3 or 4x4. Then depending on whether the letter was X or O I was able to fill every section with a red X and a blue O.

The O was blue and a lovely ellipse that took about ⅔ of the available space. The X was quite fancy in that it was red and instead of just being lines it had a style where the center point where the lines met was just a point, but the corners of the X had an area that had a cool effect.

I spent most of my day on this. I came to find out that although I did learn a lot and was able to manipulate the program to display what I wanted, it was not the best time spent.

See that is just the image on top of the cake. Sure it can make things look nice. But if the cake is not baked correctly, or tastes terrible then it doesn't matter how it looks on top it's a bad cake.

What I’m trying to say is, I spent so much time making my O and X look super rad that I needed to make sure the game functioned.

Right now I am struggling with having the computer sense my click!

This feels like the most basic part. If I can’t sense a click, how is my UI supposed to work?

Good news, I like playing around with the GUI. Things to work on, focus on the necessary bits then make the frosting pretty.

Best,

Merl

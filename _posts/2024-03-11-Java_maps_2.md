I am in the process of remaking/refactoring my previous HashMap in Java.

I decided to use my old previous tests and begin the process of Test Driven Design anew. It was interesting because I did have some curve balls in my tests that I had to figure out. One of them was having null as a key and still using that as a way to store a value.

What was interesting was my solution to those tests I had written before. Instead of having to create a literal hashmap with an array with linked lists in the buckets, I was able to make every test pass using 2 arrays.

``java
Key key;
Value value;

List<Object> list1 = new MyArrayList<>();
List<Object> list2 = new MyArrayList<>();


public void put(Key key, Value value) {
   this.key = key;
   this.value = value;
   list1.add(key);
   list2.add(value);
}
```


I used this simple method to place the pieces into their respective arrays.

Afterwards I used this for loop to find the correct key. Once that key was found, I used the same index to find the value associated with that key.

```java
public Object get(Key key) {
   if (this.key == key) {
       return value;
   } else {
       for (int i = 0; i< list1.size(); i++){
           if (key.equals(list1.get(i))){
               return  list2.get(i);
           }
       }
   }
   return null;
}
```

The same process was done in remove.

I find it interesting that using TDD you can come to a solution that you never would have imagined otherwise.

This is fascinating, however I am supposed to create an actual hashmap so this doesnâ€™t place me where I need to be.

It is an interesting side quest to learn from.

Best,

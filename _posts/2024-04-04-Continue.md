It is interesting the small things we can do to make things work very well. I have been working on my server and have had it close every now and then. This means it will work, then randomly it will break.

Initially it was because I was getting a `/favicon.ico` request. I found a work around, where I had a placeholder at my previous page, and if that request came through I called my previous page. This may not be the best idea but it is one that has worked so far.

The other problem is that randomly I will be getting `null` values from my buffered reader.

`BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(input);`
This is what kept breaking my server. And of course this would take time to restart the server, every time it broke.

I needed to fix this bug ASAP.

I was able to find the simplest solution that is quite useful.

```java
if (request == null) {
   continue;
}
```

This now allows me to keep my server running even if the request is null.

I have had no problems since!

Best,

Merl

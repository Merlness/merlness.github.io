One of the proudest moments so far has been the ability to present images/gifs/txt in my web server.

Part of the reason why I was struggling to display it at the end was because of how I was able to display information initially.

See my initially way that I was able to send information to the client was through this line of code right here

```java
Response response = handler.handle(Request.fromString(requestString));
writer.println(response);
```
The important line is the last one where I used the print line to pass my information.

Looking back it is silly to not see that this could be a problem when I would want to display a file.

The phase I had to get through first was if I was looking at  the right file and how would i transfer that information through.

```java
if (contentType.startsWith("image") || contentType.startsWith("application")) {
   byte[] byteBody;
   try {
       byteBody = Files.readAllBytes(file.toPath());
   } catch (IOException e) {
       throw new RuntimeException(e);
   }
   return new Response(200, byteBody, contentType);
}
```

The other part I had to do is have different constructors for Response, so I could place either an image like this or a txt body. I only provided the code for the image byte copying.

After passing it through to the correct places, I had to finally send it back to the client.

This next code does have the HTTP message already included in `oStream`. This code is to decide whether the response has an image or is a text file.

And Finally I found what I needed to write to send out the image to the client. Flush!

```java
if (response.byteBody != null) {
   oStream.write(response.byteBody);
} else if (response.body != null) {
   oStream.write(response.body.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
}
oStream.flush();
```

Little by little.

Best,

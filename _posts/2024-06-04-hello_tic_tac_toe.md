Milestones are important. They are like view points on a hike.

![Viewpoint](../images/milestone_small.jpg)

They help you gage where you have come from and that you still have further to go. 

I began coding about 10 months ago. It took me 2 months to go from  `hello world` 
to my first spaghetti filled unbeatable Tic Tac Toe, which of course had hundreds of lines of `if` statements. 

Now I have written Tic Tac Toe in multiple languages and styles as well. Even through this progress I haven't 
been able to show my friends and family. This was due to the game being located 
 on my terminal. 

Now the milestone is me saying "Hello World" with my online Tic Tac Toe game:


<script src="/assets/ttt_source/cljs/goog/base.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/ttt_source/styles.css">
<script src="/assets/ttt_source/cljs/ttt_merlness_dev.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">goog.require("ttt_clojure.core")</script>

<div id="ttt_merlness_dev"></div>

<script> ttt_clojure.core.main()</script>

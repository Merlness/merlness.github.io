Maybe it is a wise thing to choose a challenging story, this helps you dive into the deep end quicker. The trick is to not drown however. 

Ok, I'm being dramatic again however, I have begun a story in the productivity page, and this connects to many other parts of the code. 
Eventually I would be in the situation but I placed myself here quickly. 

There are many atoms that are being called, that is tough to figure out what they contain, and how they relate to each other. 
One atom will contain a small bit of information, but that information can be used to place into a map of another atom to recall lots of information. 

It is one thing working on your small project which you know so intimately, it is another to jump into a large project
that has multiple places that stores information which make sit challenging to learn what is going on. 

I assume this is a right of passage most people go through once they begin Internal development, or just begin working for their company in general. 

With a little help here and there hopefully I will accomplish the stories I said I would. 

Best, 

Merl

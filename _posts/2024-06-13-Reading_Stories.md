Reading is a tremendous skill in life. Writing is one of the most important inventions of our civilization. 

The ability to place information down, and refer to it later is a wonderful concept. Especially once you learn of the fragility of the human memory. 

With all of this being said it is important to read what is said for the requirements. 

Myself and a friend lost time because we didn't continually refer to the tasks we had to accomplish. 

Hidden in the tasks was a way to solve what we were looking for. 

My personal experice was to have something fall at the same rate. I got lost in the concept that I interpreted the task to have everything fall at the same `time` not `rate`.

So I fixed it so everything fell at the same time, regardless of how large a screen was present. 

However, the real task was to make sure everything fell at the same consistent rate. So I had to go back and make changes. Had I done this earlier, I would have had more time to work on my other tasks. 

Lesson learned, read more carefully. 

Best,

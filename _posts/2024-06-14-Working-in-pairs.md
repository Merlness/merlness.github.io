Working in pairs has its benefits, and a few minor cons. 

Let's list the minor cons first. 
I would say, I need to work on my typing ability as a whole along with spelling. So if 
someone is pairing with me, they might have the thought that they can type better. Next if someone switched from place to place very quickly it might be challenging to understand where the wanted code is located. 

There are probably more, but off the top of my head those are the 2 cons. 

The pros are that, you are a think tank. You can brainstorm and bounce ideas off each other to come to a correct solution. This works well for 
fixing bugs. It is easier to diagnose the problem when you have a few smart people working together. 

The other part, I enjoy social interactions, so it is a bit fun to work with someone than it is to be solo in your place with just your cat to keep you company. 

At least this way you can have a virtual human call where you can connect with others. 

Now that I think of it there can be cons in the sense where, people may disagree with a solution. However, that comes with being around people in general. 

All in all, I am pleased to be working on projects now, with others. 

Best, 

Merl

I am unsure if I should share this information. But I will anyway. 

I was unsure if I should push our changes to production recently. 

Without getting too specific, there were some changes that were made that were 
technically sound. Everything worked perfectly. 

However, some new functionality may not have been intuitive to our users so there was hesitancy. 

What if next week, our users don't know how to use our new stuff!

That would be a problem. 

Also this was Friday night and there was pressure to push. 

However, I decided not to. 

One, it seemed like I needed a "higher up" to provide more guidance. 
This feels wise on my part. 

And, if for some reason something broke, I would not want to spend the whole weekend fixing this without help. 

Another wise decision. 

So until Monday I wait!

Best, 

Merl

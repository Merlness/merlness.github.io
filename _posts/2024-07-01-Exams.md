As a teacher and former student this word brings back many memories. 

Currently, I am in the process of making sure others have the opportunity to take an exam. 

The first episode does not display the exam meant for it. This means our apprentices and clients can't take it. 

It is my duty to make sure everyone with an account can complete it. But they need to see it first. 

One of my great tools to use now is CMD + Shift + F. I can inspect whatever element I want and then find it in the code base. 

This is what I have been doing but specifically for this I looked at the exam button and the ones below it. 

I found their location and logic. 

Most of those buttons: "Exam" "Download" "Extras" and so on had 2 pieces of logic. 

    Display
    1. If element exists
    2. If the user has permission to ___

That's it. 

So what I did was find out how episode 1 was classified as. 
Since it was a free episode, it was available to everyone.

The solution was to identify how it was free and to add it to the permissions. 

Once I did that, the problem was solved. Just another day solving problems. 

Best,

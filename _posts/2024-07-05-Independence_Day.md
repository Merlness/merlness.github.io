I would say there is not much to report today. Fridays are usually spent in many meetings and company bonding events. 

I do look forward to these days however, sometimes It can be tough to be productive.

This week especially because many people were out, and also the meetings had to be moved around and there was a lot of playing things by ear. 

I was able to refactor a few things and begin working on a bug that was found recently. 

I will probably write about this later. 

Any who, I hope y'all have a good day today. 

Best, 

Merl

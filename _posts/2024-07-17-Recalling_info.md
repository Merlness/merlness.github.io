One of the best feelings so far has been recalling something I have done before. 

It is fun learning something new, but learning takes lots of effort. So it is nice sometimes to do something you have done before in order to hone your skills.  


This is that time. I had 2 stories that went along with this idea. 

The first was to help fix a copy button that the client uses. 
Before it provided a text box with the highlighted csv information. I wasn't sure if the copy already copied 
 or if I needed to do it myself from this text box. 

Something that I have done for the other websites is to make sure clicking copy copies the message. 
But to also display a flash message that says it has been copied. 

Part of the story was to apply this new functionality as well as delete the previous textbox.

Next, was to apply new tooltips to a feature. 

The first time doing this took some time and lots of effort. 

Now I have the knowledge to make a reagent component, apply the classes I want, and apply the specific functionality that I want. 

For example what I want to happen when the mouse hovers or enters. Or when the mouse clicks. Now that I have done this a few times, it is almost becoming second nature.

I know in the field you are always learning. It feels nice right now to have knowledge as to what I am doing and applying it with familiarity. 

Best, 

Merl

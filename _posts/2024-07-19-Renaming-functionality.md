One of the major lessons I learned today was how to talk to clients. 

That is something I have prided myself on. Working as a teacher for a long time, allows you the ability to converse with many different types of people. 

Not just that it provides the skill to convey challenging ideas to those that don't understand them so well. 

One of the parts I was looking forward to was speaking to clients. Having a calm and jovial nature has been my forte for quite sometime. 

One thing that I learned, is that it is important to make sure your code matches what the client knows. 

### Explanation
What I mean by this, is we have something called `tasks` in our stories. These tasks help us break up the story and provide valuable information. Now in the code
these are not called tasks, these are called `todos`. 

This may not seem like a major problem, but when a developer looks at the todos for multiple days, then the todos stick in their mind. 

Now when a dev talks to the client, they will talk about todos. But the client doesn't what a todo is. 

The client knows what a task is though. 

### Lesson

It is important that your code and what your clients knows are consistent. This way both you and your client can speak the same language. 
And there is now confusion when you communicate. 

So now I am off to change `todos` to `tasks`.

Best,

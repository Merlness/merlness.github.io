Ok, I knew this. I would say for the last couple of weeks I have not been as consistent with my TDD as I have usually been. 

This has been very evident the past 2 days. I was able to install the new features I wanted, but there was this functionality that I wanted to install. 

The small features were relatively easy to install. I did have some commented out code, but all is well, or so I thought. 

Now it came to the new features I wanted to implement. I was having a hard time doing this. 

Throughout the code there were several atom maps that were called. 
I tried using one map for this new feature. I tried the other. I tried a combination.

Now this combination helped me get close to what I wanted for my expected behaviour. 

It was not close enough however. 

So I made a small change ...

And I got stuck in a loop for hours, not knowing where my mess began because I had lots of commented out code, and just a mess everywhere. 

I finally remembered to use TDD. 

This helped me get rid of all my commented out code because now I could rely on my tests. 

This finally helped me solve my feature problem as well.  

It always goes back to the fundamentals. 

Best, 

Merl

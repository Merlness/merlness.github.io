This is a new experience for me. A feature I have worked tirelessly for, is now gone!

Ok maybe it is not that dramatic. I do have the propensity to mildly hoard. When I first started hiking, I just used 
running shoes. I kept those puppies even though I could put one hand through the sides of both shoes simultaneously, since I had worn out most of the material.
Don't worry, this is mainly for sentimental things.

What is more sentimental than your code? It did not exist before, now you created it. But I guess we are like potters. Or my idea of a potter. 
We can make the beautiful clay pots, but if it is not necessary I can recycle the material and make something new. 

I supposed, like life code is always changing. And I can't get hung up on my previous code. 

Best, 

Merl

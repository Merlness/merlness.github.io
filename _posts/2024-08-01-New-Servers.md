I have heard this sage old wisdom and took it to heart. Deploy to production in the middle of the week, so if there are any errors you are ready to fix them!
There are other reasons of course. 

I follow similar rules also, if you want a haircut or anything you want to be done well, get it "early" in the week when the workers are fresh. And if you want something done quickly and 
not necessarily well, go on a Friday afternoon. For example, say you need someone to approve your paperwork most people will be ready to get to the weekend and are efficient with their time. 

So early to middle of the week is a good time to push to production. 

However, our IPM is on Friday. We also begin our stories afterwards, and have a few commits by then. 
And when Tuesday comes around we forgot exactly what is what. If there are any migrations, then our memory isn't so good.

Even though we are ready to fix things on Tuesday, there are potentially more problems to be had the later we hold off from pushing to production. 

So it is in our best interest to push to production as quickly as possible. So everything is fresh in our minds, and if we need to fix a problem we are more aware of the code we have written. 

Push to production often, and it won't be that big of a deal when you do. Kind of like make changes to your code often, because if you hold off from making changes then it 
takes a lot of effort and becomes a big deal when you do. 

Best,

This just shows I need to dig more. 

Before I get into that reasoning, my task was to be able to make a search bar that searched for names and also email addresses. Since some of our projects are so large it is
easier to search by a company name. 

Initially this was daunting, how in the world do I display an email much less search for it?

### Display

Well this part was not too bad. Because we code so well we have a "loop" for each member being displayed, now I just had to get their email and dis play it next to their name. 


```clojure
;from this
(:name user)

;to this
(str (:name user) "\n" (:email user))
```
That wasn't so tough to display. 

### Search

Now, this was the slightly scarier part. 

How can I search and filter by an email?

Well, most of the search bars were calling this function.


```clojure
(defn filter-by-name [query entities]
  (sorted-filter-by query entities [:name]))
```

I figured, this looks promising. What If I added `:email` to this list as well?

```clojure
(defn some-component []
      (let [search-query (reagent/atom "")
            filtered-users (reagent/track #(fuzzy/sorted-filter-by @search-query users [:email :name]))])

      )
```
It turns out, this was a brilliant idea. Not a bad day.

Best,

For the past few months I have learned it is great to give yourself a cushion on estimates because you never know what will pop up as a problem. And you may want to refactor. 

The reason why I bring this up is because of the story we have been working on. Allowing a way to save a particular filter. As in if you want to display certain combinations of projects and members. 

This has been tough because we have to display it in the front end and call the back end as well. 

Not having worked in the backend as much it has been eye-opening. 

First the backend tests are so much faster. Instead of the front end compiling it has been a quick check. 

Next is the backend test code is not the same as the front end. This was after much time was spent trying to incorporate the front end db test code. Certain different namespaces had to be called to do the same thing. 

This is showing me that certain times the tests are harder to write that the production code itself. 

Which I suppose can be a good thing because this forces you to understand your code better and make your code testable. 

Along with those testing difficulties there might need to be a refactor of some of the code but because we did not give ourselves enough time, then that might be some debt we pay back later. 

Maybe I will write about it then. 

Lesson for today and months. Give yourself some cushion. 

Best, 

Merl

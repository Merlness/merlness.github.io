When implementing a new design, and you have questions about functionality, talk to your designer!

This is what I learned this week! I had been making changes to the design of our productivity report. Everything was going well, but I noticed we removed a very important bar filled with navigation. 

Now, my first instinct was to move the functionality of the bar to the new design. This was definitely a challenge but I was able to accomplish this. However from the previous tests there were about 3 tests that were driving me mad. 

Because I could not get them to pass with removing the important nav bar and implementing the functionality to the new design. 

It worked but a few tests couldn't handle it. I tried and I tried to make it work, but to no avail. 

I reached out for some help and I was given the advice to talk to the designer. So I did...

She told me to bring the bar back because we will make changes to it later on.

Had I done this in the first place I could have saved myself so much time!

Lesson learned. 

Best, 

Merl

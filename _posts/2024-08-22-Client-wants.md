The heart wants what the heart wants but so does the client. 

Not necessarily. I learned today that it is tough to anticipate what the client wants even when it comes to cold data. 

We have 2 reports and one of the problems was that I was unsure what average meant. 

We have completed points, pending points, total iterations, iterations without stories in them. So what is average points per iteration? 

Especially for an individual craftsman. 

If a craftsman jumps from project to project then if you look at one project the craftsman may not look very efficient. 

Let's say we have this information for me.

    Total points complete: 21.25
    Pending points: 6.00
    All iterations: 8
    Iterations I was in: 7

So how do you find the average? Which one of these is correct, and or what other combination will be correct?

    Avg = Total completed points / number of iterations the member is part of a story

    3.04 = 21.25 / 7

As opposed to:

    Avg = total points / every week
    
    3.40 = 27.25 / 8

It depends what the client wants, and I had to ask and make sure I knew what the client wanted. 

It turns out they want it to be

    Avg = Total Completed points / every iteration

    2.66 / 21.25 / 8

It struck me as odd as something as concrete as I thought average to be, could still be up to interpretation. 

Best,

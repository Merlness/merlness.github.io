Why logs?

Well, sometimes you come across a log in code. You turn it over and what do you find? A bunch of nasty bugs. 

This happened to me recently. Now here is the issue, I have been working on part of this codebase before, so I can't claim innocence, nor can I blame it on anyone else. 

### Story

Small personal story, when I was 23. Not very wise or domesticated I lived with my sibling and their spouse. They were very generous, and kind. I was young but foolish. 

The point of this is to show that at that time when there was an issue, I would say not my fault and move on. Whether it be dishes, or some other sor tof problem. 

My brother-in-law was a marine, not active but had been in the marines some time. He kept telling me, it doesn't matter the cause it is now everyone's responsibility to fix the problem. 

As an immature person, this is tough to hear and tough to actively learn. 

Obviously now I am incredibly wise, just kidding. Only slightly less immature. 

### Back to bugs

What I am trying to say is that regardless if I created them I need to fix them, because I am part of the system now, and it is my duty to do so. 

With that being said it is taking a long time to complete. However, since our reputation is on the line I must complete it. 

Best, 

Merl

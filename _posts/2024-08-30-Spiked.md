What are spikes? They are ways to learn about a project, a new system, or a story you want to complete. 

They are very useful when you have many unknowns. 

I wish I had known about this in the beginning, so I could have used these when I was learning something absolutely new. 

The problem is you do learn about what you will work on, but it is hard to gauge how much is perfectly accurate. 

Even right now I will be looking at multiple options and then decide which way to move forward in a story. 

The end of the spike is supposed to be an estimate for the real story. 

It is a wonderful tool, that is super helpful. I just hope when I do these my estimates are good and I can complete this new project. 

Best,

Merl

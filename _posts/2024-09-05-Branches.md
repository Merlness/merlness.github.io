Branches in git can be very useful, but you need to be careful with them. 

I have been using another branch away from out main branch. It has worked well because we are working on a major update and doing what we need to there. 

The problem is that I did some work that is not related to that update in that branch. I made 2 new useful commits in the branch instead of main. 

I was digging around trying to find ways to move the commits over. Rebasing and merging are a no-go because the project itself isn't ready. 
I found Cherry-picking, I have done this before and was planning on doing it again. Why not?

I will just move the 2 commits over no problem!

But, what about when we need to rebase the whole branch unto our main one ...

That means that we will move over the 2 commits again a long with everything else?

This could cause problems. 

Well, this is a lesson learned. 

Only work on the same project for a particular branch, and stay on main as much as possible. because it might be a while before I get to move those commits over. 

Best, 

Merl

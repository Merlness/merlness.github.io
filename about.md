Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Merl Martin.

I am in the process of becoming a better programmer.

My first career was in education, which lasted for 8 years. It was great. The kids, the staff, the parents were wonderful (most of the time). However it was time for a change, in order to seek future challenges.

As you can see from the photo above my interests are nature, traveling, and photography. Preferably all at once.

I hope you enjoy my blog.

Best,

Merl
